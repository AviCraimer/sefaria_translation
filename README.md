# Sefaria Large Language Model Translator

This is a project to automate Hebrew to English translation of texts using the Sefaria text API and the Anthropic Claude large language model.

For an example of some working translation code, see [here](https://github.com/AviCraimer/sefaria_translation/blob/main/sefaria_translation/rimmonim_translation.py).

For examples of translations produced by the system see [here](https://github.com/AviCraimer/sefaria_translation/tree/main/saved_translations_json)

Feel free to use this code with your own Anthropic API key to produce your own translations.
