<b>Gate Thirty is Called the Gate of Letter Combinations:</b>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The knowledge of the secrets of our holy Torah is through combinations, gematrias, permutations, initial letters, final letters, middle letters, initial verses, final verses, letter skipping, and letter combinations. These matters are sublime and hidden, and their secret is beyond reach, and we lack the power to grasp them due to their great concealment, for they interchange according to these methods without end and without limit. Regarding this it is said "Its measure is longer than the earth, etc." And these matters we hope will be revealed after the resurrection, after the decomposition of the coarse matter, and after the afflicted body is refined and the form remains according to its Creator's desire. And behold, we have found that this inquiry has three parts: the section of combinations, the section of permutations, and the section of gematria, and we shall proceed to explain them in these chapters.

<b>Chapter One:</b>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<b>On Combinations.</b> We learn in Sefer Yetzirah that two stones build two houses, three build six houses, four build twenty-four houses, five build one hundred and twenty houses, six build seven hundred and twenty houses, seven build five thousand and forty houses, and from there onward go forth and calculate that which the mouth cannot speak and the ear cannot hear. We have already explained in the Gate of Letters that letters are the quarried stones of Understanding, which are hidden spiritual forces, and one stone alone cannot build a house at all, but two stones build two houses, for in the combination of two letters, two words are formed, each word being one house. This means that when two letters combine together, they make two words, like this: AB BA, for the word revolves from its beginning to its end and from its end to its beginning.

When three stones combine together, they build six houses from them, like this: ABG AGB - these are two houses beginning with Alef. BAG BGA - these are two houses beginning with Bet. GAB GBA - these are two houses beginning with Gimel, totaling six houses. Four stones build twenty-four houses, how so? ABGD ABDG AGBD AGDB ADBG ADGB - these are six houses beginning with Alef. BAGD BADG BGAD BGDA BDAG BDGA - these are six houses beginning with Bet. GABD GADB GBAD GBDA GDAB GDBA - these are six houses beginning with Gimel. DBGA DGAB DAGB DBAG DABG DGBA - these are six houses beginning with Dalet. Their total amounts to twenty-four.

When we examine these combinations carefully and contemplate them, we find them systematically arranged, for in each of the four sections there is a combination of the three stones that preceded it, and the end of the twenty-four is opposite in all its aspects to the first of them. Looking at their order, we find that when we encounter a word of four, five, or six letters, we must first consider the last two stones as a single word and combine them alone. For example, with "Shlomo" - we consider the word as "MEH" alone and combine it into two houses: MEH HES (and then HEL which yields LEH HEL) (and then MEL which yields two: LEM MEL), and then we place at the beginning of each of these words the third letter, making six words for three letters. How so? For a word of LEM or MEL, we place Hey at the beginning to make HLEM or HMEL, and similarly for all three combinations we made.

In this way, we can easily combine without error even a word of ten letters if we maintain this order we have established. Now let us arrange "Shlomo" with four letters, and we find that the two letters combine together and the three combine together. This is its arrangement in four sets of six, as pure frankincense: SHLMH SHLHM SMLH SMHL SHLM SHML - these are six combinations with Shin at the beginning of all of them. Now we place Lamed as the second letter at the beginning of six second words like this: LSMH LSHM LMSH LMHS LHSM LHMS - these are six combinations with Lamed at the beginning of all of them. Now we place Mem as the third letter at the beginning of six third words like this: MSLH MSHL MLSH MLHS MHSL MHLS - these are six combinations with Mem at the beginning of all of them. Now we place Hey as the fourth letter at the beginning of six fourth words like this: HSLM HSML HLSM HLMS HMSL HMLS - these are six combinations with Hey at the beginning of all of them.

Now when we examine the initial letters of all the second words standing in a row, we find their initial letters spell "Shlomo" six times without any distortion or crookedness. When we delve deeper into these combinations, we find that when there are two stones they build only two houses, but when it rises to three, it makes three times the previous two because the third stone rotates the two, and when the third changes among three letters, sometimes strengthening this one and sometimes strengthening its companion, rising to the initial letters we find two times three which is six. Similarly, four will make four times six which is twenty-four.
